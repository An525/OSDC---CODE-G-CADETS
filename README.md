# Ayurveda Geeks
Ayurveda is a one-in-all solution concept revolving around the people who fight one on one with various problems. With it's features encapsulating solutions for majority of the problems faced by modern day, it is a tool one step ahead of the existing tech-based solutions to the problems.

# What it does?
We came up with an web application solution named **Ayurveda Geeks** especially designed to help those who are busy in their lives and tend to ignore the signs and forget to take precautions. The main motive of our Application is to spread awareness among the masses and serve as the only tool they would require to ensure their good health. Currently, it has two feature:
1) 
2) Period Tracking Calendar: If you are wondering when you last had a period or would like to know when your next one is due, you can easily find out using this feature. 
  **Sampoorna** to minimize the problems of modern day women & help them to live a healthy and care-free life. 

# What's next for Sampoorna Android App ?âœ¨
1. We want to grow our community and make Sampoorna Application available to every woman in the world. To enhance accessibility of Sampoorna to rural women, we have planned to make the safety feature available offline too.
2. We will be adding features of blogs and health tracking to detect existing symptoms in the updated versions.
