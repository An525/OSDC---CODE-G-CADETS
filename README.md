# Ayurveda Geeks
Ayurveda is a one-in-all solution concept revolving around the people who fight one on one with various problems. With it's features encapsulating solutions for majority of the problems faced by modern day, it is a tool one step ahead of the existing tech-based solutions to the problems.

# What it does?
We came up with an web application solution named **Ayurveda Geeks** especially designed to help those who are busy in their lives and tend to ignore health signs and forget to take precautions. The main motive of our Application is to spread awareness among the masses and serve as the only tool they would require to ensure their good health. It has four features:
